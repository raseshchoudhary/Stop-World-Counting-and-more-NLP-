In this file I have counted the number of stop words in a particular sentece after making a function out of it and then I applied the function to the text column of the dataset. 

# Steps followed:

1.Tokenized the sentence to convert it into words.

2.Made an empty list to be used later.

3.Made a for loop to go letter by letter and check of the word is a stop word or not.

4.If the word is a stop word then the function will append it to the list that we created in the initial stage.

5.The function the join all the stop word that are appended in the list.

6.The function will calculate the length of the words in the list thereby returning the number of stopwords in the sentence.

# Applicaion of function in the dataset

I have them applied the function to the text column of my dataset and got the top 10 sentences with most number of stop words in them.
I want to know that the highest number of stop word I had in any sentence was 1863.
